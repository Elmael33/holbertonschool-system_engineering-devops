When a user wants to visit www.foobar.com, they type the domain name into their browser. 
The browser then sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name into an IP address. 
The DNS server responds with the IP address of the server that is hosting the website.

After that, the browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server. In this case, the server 
has Nginx running as the web server. Nginx listens for incoming requests and determines 
whether the request is for static content like HTML, images, or CSS files, or if it requires dynamic content.

If the request is for static content, Nginx serves it directly. But if the request is for dynamic 
content, such as processing user data, Nginx forwards the request to the application server. 
The application server is where the business logic of the website is executed.

The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or store data needed for the website. 
For example, when a user logs in, the application server will query the database to check the credentials 
and return the appropriate response to the user.

The MySQL database stores all the dynamic data needed for the website, such as user profiles, posts, or product 
details. The database is set up as a Primary-Replica configuration, where the Primary node (Master) handles all 
write requests while the Replica node (Slave) handles read requests.

This setup allows for better performance since the application server can query the Replica node for data instead 
of overloading the Primary node with read queries. This also adds some redundancy in case the Primary node goes down, 
as the Replica node can be promoted to Primary.

The load balancer is added to this setup to manage traffic between servers and increase the availability of the website. 
It distributes incoming requests across multiple servers based on a distribution algorithm, such as round-robin or 
least connections. This helps balance the load and ensures no server becomes overwhelmed.

In the event of server failure, the load balancer can reroute traffic to another server, ensuring the website remains 
accessible. The load balancer can be set up in an Active-Active configuration, meaning all servers are active and capable 
of handling traffic simultaneously. Alternatively, an Active-Passive setup could be used, where only one server is actively 
handling requests, and the other becomes active only if the primary server fails.

However, this setup has potential Single Points of Failure (SPOF). For example, if the load balancer fails, the entire website 
becomes unavailable, and if the application server or database crashes, the website cannot function properly.

Security is another concern in this infrastructure. Without a firewall or HTTPS enabled, the servers are vulnerable to attacks 
like DDoS, man-in-the-middle attacks, or data breaches. Implementing a firewall and securing the connection with HTTPS can 
mitigate some of these risks.

Monitoring is also essential for maintaining the infrastructure. Without proper monitoring, issues like server overloads, 
database performance problems, or security vulnerabilities could go undetected. Adding a monitoring tool can help track 
server health, traffic, and other important metrics.

In summary, this three-server setup improves scalability, fault tolerance, and performance by using load balancing, application 
server separation, and a Primary-Replica database configuration. However, to address security and reliability issues, measures 
like HTTPS, firewalls, and monitoring need to be implemented.
